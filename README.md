Port blocker to disable matchmaking in Destiny 2.

#### Status

Currently a very rough WIP. UI snapshot, actual size:

![D2Solo UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30479162/74578887-09475500-4f4c-11ea-8484-a23357fc08e2.png)

See the [wiki](https://github.com/fmmmlee/D2Solo/wiki) for info.

### Current Todo:

- Mappable hotkeys
- see if there's a way to block ports without admin rights
- temporary firewall rules? that way if process is terminated unexpectedly the rules don't have to manually be removed
